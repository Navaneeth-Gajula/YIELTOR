# YIELTOR: Crop Prediction and Analysis Web Application

Yieltor is a web application designed to assist farmers and agricultural experts by predicting crop yields and providing detailed analysis based on various machine learning models. The application allows users to input relevant data, submit it for analysis, and receive both a visual display of the results and an audible response.

## Features

### üå± Crop Prediction
- **Input Data:** Users can input various parameters related to soil, weather, and other environmental factors.
- **Multiple Models:** The application utilizes several machine learning models, including:
  - Naive Bayes (NVB)
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest (RF)

### üéôÔ∏è Voice Feedback
- **Audible Results:** Once the prediction or analysis is complete, the results are spoken aloud using text-to-speech technology.
- **Visual Display:** In addition to the voice feedback, results are also displayed on the screen for easy reference.

### üìÅ File Upload & Analysis
- **Results Display:** The processed results are shown on the screen and also conveyed through voice feedback.

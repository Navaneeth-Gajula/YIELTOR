      <h3>RICE</h3>
					<p>In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ºN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 40C to 42C.</p>
			<h3>WHEAT</h3>
			   <p>Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat.Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about 14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c during this period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.

			<h3>MAIZE</h3>
				<p>Maize can be cultivated in different types of climates, but the growth, development and yield of maize is found more in the hot regions. It is a hot season crop. Night and day temperatures should be higher for its deposition. The maize crop requires sufficient moisture in the soil since its inception. Temperature of 18 to 23 degree Celsius for deposition and 28 degree Celsius temperature is considered good for growth and development.</p>
  		<h3>JUTE</h3>
				<p>Jute is the crop of hot and humid climate. It requires high temperature varying from 24°C to 35°C and heavy rainfall of 120 to 150 cm with 80 to 90 per cent relative humidity during the period of its growth Small amount of pre-monsoon rainfall varying from 25 cm to 55 cm is very useful because it helps in the proper growth of the plant till the arrival of the proper monsoon. Incessant and untimely rainfalls as well as prolonged droughts are detrimental to this crop. Rainfall between 2.5 to 7.5 cm in a month, during the sowing period, is considered to be sufficient.</p>
			<h3>SUGARCANE</h3>
				<p>The different critical stages are germination, tillering, early growth, active growth and elongation. Optimum temperature for sprouting (germination) of stem cuttings is 32° to 38°c. It slows down below 25°, reaches plateau between 30°-34°. Temperatures above 38° reduce the rate of photosynthesis and increase respiration. For ripening, however, relatively low temperatures in the range of 12° to 14° are desirable.</p>
			<h3>APPLE</h3>
				<p>The apple is a temperate fruit crop. However, in India the apple growing areas do not fall in temperate zone but the prevailing temperate climate of the region is due to the Himalayan ranges and high altitudes. The average summer temperature should be around 21-24oC during active growth period. Apple succeeds best in regions where the trees experience uninterrupted rest in winter and abundant sunshine for good colour development. It can be grown at an altitude of 1500- 2700 m above the sea level. Well-distributed rainfall of 1000-1250 mm throughout the growing season is most favourable for optimum growth and fruitfulness of apple trees.</p>
			<h3>BANANA</h3>
				<p>Banana is essentially tropical plant requiring a warm and humid climate. However, it can be grown
from sea level to all altitudes of 1200 metres. It can be cultivated in a temperature range of 10°C
and 40°C with high humidity but growth is retarded at temperatures of 20°C and less and more 0
than 35°C. Yields are higher when temperatures are above 24 C for a considerable period. In
cooler climate, the crop requires longer time to mature. Plants exposed to low temperature and
humidity during active growth stage show reduced growth and yields. Hot winds blowing in high
speed during the summer month's shred and desiccate the leaves. It requires on an average, 1700
mm rainfall distributed throughout the year for its satisfactory growth. Stagnation of water is
injurious and may cause diseases like Panama wilt.</p>
			<h3>BLACKGRAM</h3>
				<p>Ideal temperature for its cultivation ranges between 25°C to 35°C but it can tolerate temperature up to 42°C. Black gram is a tropical crop & it requires hot & humid climate. Heavy rains during flowering stage are harmful to the crop as it adversely affects the production of the crop.</p>
			<h3>CHICKPEA</h3>
				<p>Chickpea is a cool season food legume and grown as a winter crop in the
tropics and as a summer or spring crop in the temperate environments. It
likes cool, dry and bright weather. Temperature, day length and availability
of moisture are the three major abiotic factors affecting fl owering. In general,
fl owering is delayed under low temperatures and also under short-days.
Genetic variability exists in chickpea germplasm for response to variation
in day length (photoperiod sensitivity) and also for response to variation in
temperature (thermal sensitivity) and has been exploited in development
of short-duration cultivars. Chickpea is sensitive to high (maximum daily
temperature >35°C) as well as low (mean of maximum and minimum daily
temperatures < 15°C) temperatures at the reproductive stage. Both extremes
of temperatures lead to fl ower drop and reduced pod set.</p>
			<h3>COCONUT</h3>
				<p>The coconut palm is found to grow under varying climatic and soil conditions. It is essentially a tropical plant, growing most!y between 20° N and 20° S latitudes. The ideal temperature for coconut growth and yield is 27 ± 5° C and humidity > 60 per cent. The coconut palm grows well upto an elevation of 600 m above MSL. However, near the equator, productive coconut plantations can be established up to an elevation of about 1000 m above MSL. The palms tolerate wide range in intensity and distribution of rainfall. However, a well distributed rainfall of about 200 cm per year is the best for proper growth and higher yield. In areas of inadequate rainfall with uneven distribution, irrigation is required.</p>
			<h3>COTTON</h3>
				<p>Cotton is a plant that needs a long frost-free period, a lot of heat and plenty of sunshine. It prefers warm and humid climate. Cotton seeds will have a small germination rate, if the soil temperature is below 60°F (15°C). During active growth, the ideal air temperature is 70 to 100°F (21-37°C). Temperatures well above 100°F are not desirable. However, the average cotton plant can survive in temperatures up to 110°F (43°C) for short periods without great damage, but this also depends on the humidity levels. In order to cultivate cotton plants successfully, we shall not have frequent rainfalls during the maturing (summer) and during the days of harvest (during autumn).</p>
			<h3>COFFEE</h3>
				<p>Coffee is a tropical plant which is also grown in a semi-tropical climate. This plant requires heat, humidity and abundant rainfall to grow and yield well. Coffee requires an average temperature of 15℃ to 28℃ . Growth of the coffee plants is very rapid during the hot rainy season and during the cool dry season the berries get ripened and ready to be plucked. Bright sunshine and warm weather are necessary for harvesting. Coffee needs abundant rainfall that is nearly 100-200 cm annually. The hill slopes that receive orographic rain are thus best suited for coffee cultivation.</p>
			<h3>GRAPES</h3>
				<p>Grapes generally require a hot and dry climate during its growth and fruiting periods. It is successfully 0 0 grown in areas where the temperature range is from 15-40 C. High temperatures above 40 C during
the fruit growth and development reduce fruit set and consequently the berry size. Low temperatures 0 below 15 C followed by forward pruning impair the budbreak leading to crop failure.
The fruitfulness of buds is influenced by light. Light intensity of 2,400-ft. candle is essential for optimum
growth. However, low light intensities during the active growth stage (45-75 days after pruning) and
fruit bud formation adversely affects the crop.
It is most successfully grown at elevations ranging from 200-250m above m.s.l.
Area with annual rainfall not exceeding 900mm well distributed throughout the year is ideal. However,
rainfall during flowering and fruit ripening is not favourable as it leads to the spread of downy mildew
disease.
High atmospheric humidity is detrimental during vegetative growth and fruiting. At a high humidity the
vegetative growth of vines is vigorous which affects the fruit size and quality. Similarly high humidity
during 30-110 days after forward pruning favours the development of fungal diseases.</p>
			<h3>KIDNEYBEANS</h3>
				<p>This crop grows well in tropical and temperate areas receiving 60 to 150 cm of rainfall annually. Ideal temperature for better yield is 15°C to 25°C.</p>
			<h3>LENTIL</h3>
				<p>Lentil requires cold climate. It is very hardy and can tolerate frost and severe winter to a great extent. It require cold temperature during its vegetative growth and warm temperature at the time of maturity. The optimum temperature for growth is 18-30°C.</p>
			<h3>MANGO</h3>
				<p>Mango is very well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives well in almost all the regions
0 0 of the country from sea level to an altitude of 600 m. The ideal temperature range for mango is 24 -30 C
during the growing season, along with high humidity. A rainfall range of 890-1,015 mm in a year is
considered as ideal for growing mangoes. However, mango can be grown in regions of both heavy
(2540 mm) or scanty (254 mm) rainfall. Dry weather before blossoming is conducive to profuse
flowering. Rain during flowering is detrimental to the crop as it interferes with pollination. </p>
			<h3>MOTHBEANS</h3>
				<p>The ideal temperature level for growing Moth bean is between 24°C and 32°C. But the Moth bean plants can also tolerate up to 45°C during the day. The ideal annual rainfall is between 500 and 750 mm is required for growing Moth bean and also does well with 300 mm annual rainfall.</p>
			<h3>MUNGBEANS</h3>
				<p>Mungbean grows in a wide range of climatic conditions. A warm humid climate with temperature ranging from 25⁰ C to 35⁰ C, with 400-550 mm rainfall, well distributed during the growing period of 60 - 90 days, is suitable for cultivation.</p>
			<h3>MUSKMELON</h3>
				<p>Muskmelon is usually grown from late Novembers to late February and some off-season varieties are also grown by our Indian farmers. Muskmelons can grow better at the temperatures range in between 180C to 25 0C and temperatures below 12 0C the plant growth may be halted with poor performance and muskmelons can withstand upto 45 0C temperature among some varieties.</p>
			<h3>ORANGE</h3>
				<p>A dry climate with about 50-75 cm of rainfall from June-September and with well defined summer and winter season is ideal. Sweet orange can be grown even upto an elevation of 900 m above mean sea level. The extreme of temperature are necessary for achieving higher yield.</p>
			<h3>PAPAYA</h3>
				<p>Papaya grows well in sun, warm & humid climate. The plant can be grown
to elevation of 1000 in above the sea level but can't withstand frost. Ideal
temperature for papaya is between 25 to 30 degree centigrade. Temp.
bellow 10 degree centigrade inhibits growth, maturity and ripening of fruits.
Dry climate during flowering often causes sterility, while dry climate during
fruit maturity adds to the sweetness of fruit</p>
			<h3>PIGEONPEAS</h3>
				<p>Pigeonpea is predominantly a crop of tropical areas mainly cultivated in semi arid regions of India. Pigeonpea can be grown with a temperature ranging from 26°C to 30°C in the rainy season (June to October) and 17°C to 22°C in the post rainy (November to March) season.</p>
			<h3>POMEGRANATE</h3>
				<p>Arid and semi-arid regions having annual rainfall 500 to 1000 mm with long, hot and dry summer and mild winter are suitable for pomegranate growing. It can easily tolerate temperatures up to 45-48°C along with dry hot winds. There are many commercial varieties which are cultivated in different parts of India</p>
			<h3>WATERMELON<h3>
					<p>Watermelon cultivation is more in dry climatic conditions. The season for these melon crops starts just after the receding of north east monsoon rains. The soil temperatures usually will range from 18 0C to 20 0C but extreme chillness can cause problems.The light and temperature are vital requirements for proper flowering in watermelon crop.</p>
